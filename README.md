# A Squares Solver

I had a bit of a squares.org binge for a while and some of the puzzles were insanely difficult and I couldn't find any help online
because the puzzles change each day.

I thought to myself that there's probably a algorithmic way of finding the answers using some sort of dictionary API so I started
tinkering with a few different ideas. 25 hours later I came up with this code.

## Important Note

Change lines 25-30 of the squares_solver.py file to match the board you want to solve and then run the code in that file in order
to see the solution.

This solver is NOT perfect and will get you about 80% - 90% of the answers. This is because there is no way to determine what word
set Squares.org uses to determine things such as what is considered a "bonus word" versus a correct answer.
